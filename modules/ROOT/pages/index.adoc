= Welcome to DataStax Luna Streaming
John Smart <john.smart@datastax.com>

DataStax Luna Streaming is a new Kubernetes-based distribution of Apache Pulsar, based on the technology that Kesque built to run its Pulsar-as-a-service.

In addition to Apache Pulsar itself, Luna Streaming provides:

* An installer that can stand up a dev or production cluster on bare metal or VMs without a pre-existing Kubernetes environment

* A helm chart that can deploy and manage Pulsar on your current Kubernetes infrastructure

* Cassandra, Elastic, Kinesis, Kafka, and JDBC connectors

* A management Admin Console

* A monitoring and alerting system
